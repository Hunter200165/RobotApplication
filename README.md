# RobotApplication

Although this repository was not created by me, trust me - it is my application. Just because Space-Dragons was my team's account which was created before password changing politics, and also it was unfortunately bound to the blocked mail. So, I could not restore access to this repository. 

And not to lost all the progress I have made in RobotApplication, I made a fork, which will be the mail direction of development (if will be developen ever). 

Note, this is old and very specific code, means not everyone will be able to use it, and I generally do not recommend using this repository, maybe just see what is happening, but definetely not using
